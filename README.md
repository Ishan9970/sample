# **Spam Mail Detection Using Machine Learning**  
This project implements a **spam email detection system** using various **machine learning algorithms**. It classifies emails as **spam or ham (not spam)** based on their content by converting text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization** and training models to make accurate predictions.  

## **Key Features**  
‚úÖ **Dataset**: Used a dataset with **5,572 emails**, labeled as spam or ham.  
‚úÖ **Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data, removed stop words, and applied **TF-IDF transformation**.  
‚úÖ **Machine Learning Models Used**:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Naive Bayes**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
‚úÖ **Performance Analysis**: Evaluated models based on accuracy and visualized results using a bar graph.  

## **How It Works**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Load the dataset** and preprocess it.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Convert text to numerical form** using TF-IDF.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Train machine learning models** on the dataset.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Test and compare accuracy** of different models.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Predict spam or ham** for new email inputs.  

## **Future Improvements**  
üöÄ Explore deep learning models like **LSTM or BERT** for better accuracy.  
üìß Incorporate **metadata like email headers** for improved classification.
